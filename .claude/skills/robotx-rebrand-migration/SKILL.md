# RobotX Rebrand Migration

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when any request includes:
- Rebranding Airbnb-style UX/copy to RobotX service rental language.
- Updating service taxonomy, category filters, booking copy, or service detail text.
- Updating or normalizing UI theme colors to white/gray/black.
- Adding or validating `robotxshop.com` cross-link placements.
- Enforcing RobotX admin-only mutation rules for service catalog endpoints.
- Running Supabase checks/migrations/policies for this repo.
- Running migration QA checks to detect regressions in wording, taxonomy, or authorization.

## Workflow
Follow this sequence unless the user requests a narrower scope.

### 1. Scan legacy wording
- Run `scripts/find_legacy_terms.sh <repo_path>`.
- Review hits and classify:
  - customer-facing copy (must change now)
  - internal identifiers (change only when low-risk)
  - historical docs (change if still user-facing or onboarding-critical)

### 2. Update taxonomy sources
- Canonical categories are fixed to:
  - `Showcase & Performance`
  - `Warehouse`
  - `Restaurant`
- Update category constants/UI filters first.
- Keep route/API shapes unchanged in MVP.
- Run `scripts/validate_service_categories.sh <repo_path>`.

### 3. Rebrand booking and service copy
- Prioritize user-facing components:
  - category/filter chips
  - search modal
  - create-service modal
  - listing/service cards
  - listing/service detail page
  - navbar/footer CTAs
- Apply canonical terminology map from `references/term-map.md`.

### 4. Normalize theme colors
- Set user-facing palette to white/gray/black only.
- Replace legacy accent colors (for example rose/coral/indigo/blue) with neutral grayscale classes or tokens.
- Prefer centralized theme tokens in Tailwind/CSS over scattered hardcoded hex values.
- Verify there are no non-neutral color regressions in updated files.

### 5. Enforce catalog ownership rules
- RobotX-managed catalog only in MVP.
- Non-admin users cannot create/edit/delete services.
- Enforce at API layer with `ROBOTX_ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist, even if UI is hidden.

### 6. Add or verify cross-domain CTA
- Ensure visible `robotxshop.com` link exists in navbar and footer.
- Keep it as marketing cross-link only (no unified checkout or identity assumptions).

### 7. Validate
- Run quality checks:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run build`
- Execute smoke scenarios from `references/qa-checklist.md`.

### 8. Supabase operations (when requested)
- Confirm env readiness with `scripts/check_supabase_env.sh <repo_path>`.
- Use `SUPABASE_URL` if present, otherwise use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.
- Apply non-destructive checks first (introspection, policy verification, migration dry checks).
- Treat destructive/production-impacting actions as confirmation-required.

### 9. Report
Provide:
- file-level patch summary
- validation evidence
- unresolved risks or deferred items (especially anything in out-of-scope list)

## Rules
- Preserve existing route and API paths in MVP.
- Do not run schema migrations unless explicitly requested.
- Keep Prisma models structurally unchanged in MVP.
- `Listing.category` semantics must map to one of the 4 RobotX services.
- `Listing.price` is per-day service pricing.
- `locationValue` is service coverage area.
- No Airbnb wording in new user-facing copy.
- Theme colors in user-facing UI must stay within white/gray/black unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Never expose Supabase secret values in outputs.

## Required references
- `references/term-map.md`
- `references/repo-hotspots.md`
- `references/qa-checklist.md`
- `references/acceptance-criteria.md`
- `references/supabase-operations.md`

## Expected output format
For migration tasks, output should include:
1. Files changed and why.
2. Commands run and key results.
3. Acceptance criteria pass/fail summary.
4. Explicit deferred items tied to out-of-scope policy.
